https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/download_data_fincen_files.zip[*Files are available for download now*], via from: https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/download-fincen-files-transaction-data/

The download contains two CSV files with the same data as our JSON so I'll adjust the instructions below.

The files here were scraped from their site (https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/explore-the-fincen-files-data/[Explore The FinCen Data Files])

.ICIJ used Neo4j and Linkurious again for their investigation
====
Lastly, ICIJ used charting databases (Neo4J and Linkurious) to visualize and explore the 400 FinCEN Files spreadsheets containing data on 100,000 transactions. 
These were some of the many tools to help rebuild the nuanced picture of a broken system.

* https://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7473 (user, password, database = fincen)

Sandbox

* Sandbox: https://10-0-1-92-35670.neo4jsandbox.com/browser/ (user, password = fincen)
* Bloom: https://10-0-1-92-35670.neo4jsandbox.com/browser/bloom/

=== Dump File

* link:fincen.dump[fincen.dump]
* To import into Neo4j Aura, use the "Upload Data" feature and drop the dump file
* For Neo4j Desktop, add the file to your project and use the "Imort Dump" from the 3-dots menu to import
* For manual import use `neo4j-admin load --from fincen.dump` in a stopped dmbs 
* For a running 4.x Enterprise dbms, you need to add `--database fincen` and then use `:use system` and `create database fincen` to activate it.

image::bloom-fincen.png[width=800]

In Neo4j Bloom, you can e.g. search for `Filing Entity` in the search bar.

You can configure the sidebar with icons for Countries, Entities and filings

You can set a rule based styling e.g. for Filings, I did a size based on `amount` with the min `100000` to `0.5x` and the max `100000000` to `2x`
